¬† <h1>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Open Source Development</h1>
¬† <strong>An open-source specification proposed for the NTCIP Joint Committee</strong>
</div>

<br>

[Main Site](https://k-vaughn.github.io/ITS-open-source/)

This specification defines the process to be used to maintain open-source resources of the NTCIP Joint Committee. This specification is itself an open-source resource, which is maintained by the process defined by this specification. Anyone who wishes to contribute to or maintain an NTCIP open-source resource project should start by familiarizing themselves with the processes defined by this specification.

This specification is adapted from the [OpenSauced Introduction](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro) and tailored to meet the needs of the ITS community. While a product of NTCIP, it is envisioned to be used in open-source efforts beyond the NTCIP community and it can be further tailored to meet the needs of each ITS open-source resource project.
