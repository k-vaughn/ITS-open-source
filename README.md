## Project Summary

### Status

The project is currently a proposal and has not been reviewed by the broader NTCIP community. As such it is hosted on the proposer's GitHub account at https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source.

### Overview

The ITS Openb-Source Process defines the process to be used to maintain open-source resources of the NTCIP Joint Committee. This specification itself is proposed to be an open-source resource, which is maintained by the process defined by the specification. Anyone who wishes to contribute to or maintain an NTCIP open-source resource project should start by familiarizing themselves with [this process](https://k-vaughn.github.io/ITS-open-source/).

This specification is adapted from the [OpenSauced Introduction](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro) and tailored to meet the needs of the ITS community. While a product of NTCIP, it is envisioned to be used in open-source efforts beyond the NTCIP community and it can be further tailored to meet the needs of each ITS open-source resource project.

### Acknowledgements
This project is sponsored by the Base Standards and Profiles 2 Working Group (BSP2 WG) of the National Transportation Communications Interface Protocols (NTCIP) Joint Committee (JC), a joint standardization committee of the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). It has benefited from funding from the US Department of Transportation (USDOT).

## ü§ù Open-Source Development

Within traditional standards development processes, stakeholder concerns are reported as comments, primarily during defined stages of the project. Within an open-source environment, concerns are documented as issues and can be submitted at any time. 

All updates to the project are initiated by a stakeholder first reporting an issue. Issues can be as minor as reporting a typo or as major as suggesting a new section or complete rewrite of the document. If you have identified an issue, please submit it on our [Issues](https://k-vaughn.github.io/ITS-open-source/issues) page.

When submitting an issue, the commenter is required to identify the type of issue and then provide specific information for that issue. Issue types that are applicable to this project include:

- **Bug report:** used to report an issue or inaccuracy in the documentation
- **Documentation enhancement:** used to suggest improvements to the project documentation
- **New requirement request:** used to propose a new requirement to be added to the documentation
- **Requirement modification request:** used to suggest a modification to an existing requirement

If you identify a security issue, please report it using our [security process](SECURITY.md).

As with comments in the traditional standards process, issues are reviewed and prioritized prior to being addressed. In the traditional process, the initial review is performed by the editor; within the open-source process, the review is performed by the maintainer. Depending on the impact of the issue, the maintainer can either prioritize the issue directly or might seek guidance from the working group.

Once an issue has been prioritized, it is made available for anyone in the open-source community to make a contribution to address the issue.
