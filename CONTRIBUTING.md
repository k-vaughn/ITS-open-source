# Contributions to the ITS Open-Source Process

Contributions to the ITS Open Source Process are always welcome, no matter how large or small. However, before contributing to any project, it's important to familiarize yourself with the project's guidelines, conventions, and workflow. 

The ITS Open-Source Process project is reflexive: i.e., the goal of the project is to define the process by which open-source projects are developed, with the ITS Open-Source Process project being one such project.

The ITS Open-Source Process project does not make any exceptions or extensions to the process defined by the ITS Open-Source Process.

The project is currently a proposal and has not been reviewed by the broader NTCIP community. As such it is hosted at https://github.com/k-vaughn/ITS-open-source.
