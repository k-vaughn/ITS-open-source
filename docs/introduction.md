# Introduction

This site defines the ITS Open-Source Process as used by several projects within the ITS standards community. The process follows general practices within the larger open-source community; however, this document: 

- provides a step-by-step overview of the process, so that those unfamiliar with open-source processes can better understand the process and become contributors,
- formalizes the process (e.g., by clearly defining what are requirements), and
- tailors the process (e.g., by defining the preferred tools to be used).

This document contains one normative annex.

The following keywords apply to this document:  AASHTO, ITE, NEMA, NTCIP, open-source, process.
