##### Installation

This guide should include instructions for the following:

- forking the repository
- cloning the repository
- installing the dependencies
- setting up the environment variables
- setting up the database, if applicable
- running the project locally
- setting up Docker containers, if applicable

The best way to test your guide is by setting up the project locally using your guide. If you encounter issues getting your project to work, you will discover it quickly and can update the documentation to add or clarify the missing piece.

The installation guide is best placed at the top of your project's README file, as it is the most accessible file for your contributors.

Another good place would be in the CONTRIBUTING file. Besides providing guidelines about contributing to your project, this file can include installation setup, testing, linting, workflows, etc. You can place the installation instructions towards the top or bottom of your CONTRIBUTING file. You can take a look at [OpenSauced Contributing Guidelines](https://opensauced.pizza/docs/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/) as an inspiration.

If your project is on the larger side, consider having a separate documentation site and dedicating a section for installation there. You can use documentation site generators like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), or [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/).
